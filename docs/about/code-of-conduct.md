# Code of Conduct

## Engineering & Scientific Principles
We are an engineering firm, thus everything we do is planned elaborately, 
anticipated, thought of ahead of time, and when the unexpected happens, 
we have a contingency plan to apply. Anticipating problems ahead of time is a difficult task that might seem impossible, 
but this becomes achievable by following engineering and scientific principles.

## Quality, Reliability and Maintainability
We do not deliver unfinished work. Everything we do is 100% completed, otherwise the work is be marked as __"Incomplete"__, 
and it stays open for work with a high level of priority until completed. When we have to wait for an external input, 
we simulate and anticipate this part, then we will replace it with the actual external input, instead of waiting and blocking the project. 
We aim to underpromise and overdeliver, but If necessary, 
we Slow Down, Stop, or even Go Backwards but never deliver incomplete products/services to our clients/customers.

## Project Execution
We listen to our clients' and customers' requirements, opinions, goals, hopes, vision, and dreams about the software we're building. 
We extend this by conducting extensive research on the project on hand. However, 
we take the responsibility and we are the decision makers when it comes to the techniques, methods, timelines, 
and feasibility of the project implementation and execution. 
All of which are completely transparent and clearly communicated with the client/customer. 
We don't accept intervention from clients/customers unless a mutual technical agreement is in place.

## Transparency
All formal communications are logged and accessible by relevant parties. 
Anything we execute corresponds to a well documented and transparent set of instructions and requirements that's communicated with clients/customers or/and internally between our team members. 
The work progress, issues, and resolutions are also documented in a transparent manner. 
Other forms of communication like physical or virtual meetings or phone calls are also be documented as a (Minutes of Meeting) document, 
and it is accessible to all relevant parties.
and it is accessible to all relevant parties.
