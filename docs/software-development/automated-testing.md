# Automated Testing
In all cases, the developer tests the software as they're writing code. 
This testing could be manual or automated.

Manual testing is unreliable and not easily repeatable. 
This is why we adopt Automated Testing from the inception of the software we're developing.

Of course, the Automated Tests are not only useful for the developer's local development experience. 
But it's also a crucial component of the [Continuous Integration](continuous-integration.md) Pipeline.
